Option pricing related work is gathered together and packaged into Excel Add-in. This repo will be updated constantly, either to add more asset classes and pricing methods or improve/solve outstanding issues. 

After importing the Excel Add-in, the pricing functions for different kind of options can be used directly after specifying method and related parameters. All of the options are under "OptionPricer" function sub category.
